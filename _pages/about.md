Hello, World! 

I am a Lecturer in Data Science at the Department of Statistics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.<br>

As an applied data scientist, my research focuses on designing, implementing and leveraging modern statistical tools to address real-world problems. The overarching goal of my work is to improve the way we use data to answer societally relevant questions, with a focus on applications in the socio-economic sciences and public health. 

From a methodological perspective, my research interests can be broadly categorized in three areas, namely social network modeling, models for monitoring epidemics, and methods for quantifying the impact of crises. Furthermore, I enjoy collaborating with empirical researchers from diverse fields, to help bridge the gap between theory and applications. As a believer in open and accessible research, I'm also a fellow of the [LMU Open Science Initiative in Statistics](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/members/osis/index.html), where we foster reproducible data analysis and data literacy.<br>

I hold a PhD in Statistics from the LMU Munich, an MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from Bocconi University, and a BSc in Statistics from the University of Florence.<br>
