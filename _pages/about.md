Hello, World! 

My name is Giacomo De Nicola, and I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Statistics of LMU Munich under the supervision of GÃ¶ran Kauermann.<br>

As an applied data scientist, my research focuses on designing and leveraging modern statistical tools to answer questions posed within the social, political, economic and healthcare sciences. The overarching goal of my work is to establish and consolidate methodologies that improve our understanding of society, with particular focus on applications with tangible real-world impact. More specifically, my research interests can be roughly categorized in three parts, namely social and economic network modeling, models for monitoring epidemics, and methods for excess mortality estimation. I am also a member of the German Statistical Society and a fellow of the [LMU Open Science Center](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/members/osis/index.html), where we foster open and reproducible research.<br>
